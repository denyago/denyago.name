This is the homepage of RClone Local for Denys application.

**If you are reading this page, you are either from Google or came by mistake.**

This app is a way to enable the backup of some Google Drive folders to my local server.
It is not supposed to be used by anybody except myself. 
So, someone is tricking you if you are from something other than Google and not _me_.
Unless you are an employee of Google, click "Deny" on the Google OAuth screen and write a line to me.
Thanks.
